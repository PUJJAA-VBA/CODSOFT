# Project Overview

## Project Description

This repository contains three different Python projects that showcase simple yet functional applications using the Tkinter library for graphical user interfaces. Each project is designed to help beginners understand basic programming concepts and GUI development with Python.

### Projects Included

1. **Calculator**
2. **Rock Paper Scissors Game**
3. **To-Do List**

## Calculator

A simple graphical calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator supports decimal numbers and includes a clear button to reset the input.

### Features

- Basic arithmetic operations
- Decimal support
- Clear functionality
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- User-friendly interface with Tkinter

### Installation
